# Scheduler

This is the planning document for the scheduler.

I want a header, image, and a breif explaination of what a scheduler does. Then the actual scheduler. 

The scheduler should be a table with a time table from 8AM to 5PM, with 4 work days.

Below the table there should be a input field with 5 inputs: The label (name), Day, Starting Time, Length, and the Colour. 

- The label or name of the time
- The day
- The starting time (e.g. 8:00AM)
- The length of the appointment (e.g. 2 Hours)
- The Colour (e.g. #FF0000 or Pure Red)

Below that should be a button to add it to the table.

The element would be added to a list after it passes conflict/invalid value tests.
If a value is invalid or conflicting, the user should be alerted of the fact.

Elements should be able to be deleted by clicking on them.

Then add elements and other tags to taste to satisfy the project requirments.
